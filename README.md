# Memory-Game-(C++ Project)

The game is about finding the matching pairs hidden in the 5 x 4 matrix. The matrix elements are composed of numbers and characters. The matrix consists of 20 elements. Of which 10 of them are unique. The other 10 elements are the repetitions of the unique ones to match the elements in the cells. The initial screen displays the 5 x 4 matrix with all the elements being hidden under the ‘@’ symbol. The
rows are named as ‘A’,’B’,’C’,’D’,’E’ and the column are named as ‘0’,’1’,’2’,’3’.
The user needs to enter the cell number to open the respective cell. For example,‘D3’ opens ‘Fourth row Fourth column element’.And so on. If the two-consecutive turned out cells do not match, then they are turned back to the default symbol (‘@’) when the third cell number is entered. On the other hand, if the turned-out cells match, then the cell values remain visible. We have to find the next pair in the similar manner. When all the cells are turned out with the matching values, the GAME is OVER. A screen shows the number of tries taken to complete the matching pairs will be displayed. If user wants to continue the game, user can press ‘Y’ to go to the initial screen to continue the game. User can enter “-1” to terminate the game at any point of time.
